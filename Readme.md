# LAN Design Project

This repository contains the documentation for the LAN design project.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `Отчет.docx` - Main report document with the LAN design and research
- `Проект физического уровня.vsd` - Visio diagram with the physical layer design
- `Проект сетевого уроня.pkt` - Cisco Packet Tracer file with a model of designed LAN
- `Схема сетевого уровня.png` - Schema of modeled LAN exported from Packet Tracer  
- `Расчет стоимости проекта.xlsx` - Table with cost calculations
- `Тестирование` - Folder with screenshots from testing the network model

## About

This is a course project for designing and modeling a corporate local area network (LAN) for a small business organization. 

The project covers:

- Analyzing LAN basics and describing the company
- Developing physical and network layer designs
- Cost calculations for equipment and installation
- Building a model of designed LAN in Cisco Packet Tracer
- Testing the model to verify implemented functions

## Usage

The contents of this repository can be used as a basis for implementing a real corporate LAN.

The reports, diagrams, model, calculations demonstrate skills in network design and modeling using common tools like Visio, Excel, Cisco Packet Tracer.

The testing results confirm the developed LAN model works correctly and meets technical and business requirements.

## Feedback

Any feedback and suggestions for improving this project are very welcomed!
